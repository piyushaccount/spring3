## What is this book about?
Spring Boot 3 brings more than just the powerful ability to build secure web apps on top of a rock-solid database. It delivers new options for testing, deployment, Docker support, and native images for GraalVM, along with ways to squeeze out more efficient usage of existing resources.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Create powerful, production-grade web applications with minimal fuss
* Support multiple environments with one artifact, and add production-grade support with features
* Find out how to tweak your Java apps through different properties
* Enhance the security model of your apps
* Make use of enhancing features such as native deployment and reactive programming in Spring Boot
* Build anything from lightweight unit tests to fully running embedded web container integration tests
* Get a glimpse of reactive programming and decide if it's the right approach for you

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Ch2.

The code will look like the following:
```
@Controller
public class HomeController {
  private final VideoService videoService;
  public HomeController(VideoService videoService) {
    this.videoService = videoService;
  }

  @GetMapping("/")
  public String index(Model model) {
    model.addAttribute("videos", videoService.getVideos());
    return "index";
  }
}
```

* In Chapter 4, under the section "Invoking an OAuth2 API remotely," there is a missing code snippet after the provided snippet on pages 108-109.

**Original Code Snippet (Pages 108-109):**

```java
@Configuration
public class YouTubeConfig {

  static String YOUTUBE_V3_API = //
    "https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3";

  @Bean
  WebClient webClient( //
    OAuth2AuthorizedClientManager clientManager) {

      new ServletOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction( //
        clientManager);
    oauth2.setDefaultClientRegistrationId("google");

    return WebClient.builder() //
      .baseUrl(YOUTUBE_V3_API) //
      .apply(oauth2.oauth2Configuration()) //
      .build();
  }
}
```

**Missing Code Snippet:**
```
@Bean

  return HttpServiceProxyFactory.builder() //
    .clientAdapter(WebClientAdapter.forClient(oauth2WebClient)) //

@Bean
YouTube client(HttpServiceProxyFactory factory) {
  return factory.createClient(YouTube.class);
}
```
**Updated Code Snippet (Including Missing Code):**
```
@Configuration
public class YouTubeConfig {

  static String YOUTUBE_V3_API = //
    "https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3";

  @Bean
  WebClient webClient( //
    OAuth2AuthorizedClientManager clientManager) {

    ServletOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction oauth2 = //
      new ServletOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction( //
        clientManager);
    oauth2.setDefaultClientRegistrationId("google");

    return WebClient.builder() //
      .baseUrl(YOUTUBE_V3_API) //
      .apply(oauth2.oauth2Configuration()) //
      .build();
  }

  @Bean
  HttpServiceProxyFactory proxyFactory(WebClient oauth2WebClient) {
    return HttpServiceProxyFactory.builder() //
      .clientAdapter(WebClientAdapter.forClient(oauth2WebClient)) //
      .build();
  }

  @Bean
  YouTube client(HttpServiceProxyFactory factory) {
    return factory.createClient(YouTube.class);
  }
}
```
Please update the `YouTubeConfig.java` file with the above complete code snippet to ensure completeness in configuring the HTTP service proxy and creating the YouTube client.
